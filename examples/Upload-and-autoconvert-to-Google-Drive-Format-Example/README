This script uploads a file to a folder on Google Drive. If the file can be
converted into the Google format, such as a Google Sheet, it will be converted.

To run the script you need to complete the following steps:
1. Update settings.yaml with your:
   - client ID,
   - client secret, and
   - credential storage path
2. Update upload.py with the location you save your settings.yaml file. This
   can be an absolute or relative path.
