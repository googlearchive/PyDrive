-------

*PyDrive* is a wrapper library of
`google-api-python-client <https://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/>`_
that simplifies many common Google Drive API tasks.

Features of PyDrive
-------------------

-  Simplifies OAuth2.0 into just few lines with flexible settings.
-  Wraps `Google Drive API <https://developers.google.com/drive/>`_ into
   classes of each resource to make your program more object-oriented.
-  Helps common operations else than API calls, such as content fetching
   and pagination control.

How to install
--------------

You can install PyDrive with regular ``pip`` command.

::

    $ pip install PyDrive

To install the current development version from GitHub, use:

::

    $  pip install git+https://github.com/gsuitedevs/PyDrive.git#egg=PyDrive

OAuth made easy
---------------

Download *client\_secrets.json* from Google API Console and OAuth2.0 is
done in two lines. You can customize behavior of OAuth2 in one settings
file *settings.yaml*.

.. code:: python


    from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth
    from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive

    gauth = GoogleAuth()
    gauth.LocalWebserverAuth()

    drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)

File management made easy
-------------------------

Upload/update the file with one method. PyDrive will do it in the most
efficient way.

.. code:: python

    file1 = drive.CreateFile({'title': 'Hello.txt'})
    file1.SetContentString('Hello')
    file1.Upload() # Files.insert()

    file1['title'] = 'HelloWorld.txt'  # Change title of the file
    file1.Upload() # Files.patch()

    content = file1.GetContentString()  # 'Hello'
    file1.SetContentString(content+' World!')  # 'Hello World!'
    file1.Upload() # Files.update()

    file2 = drive.CreateFile()
    file2.SetContentFile('hello.png')
    file2.Upload()
    print('Created file %s with mimeType %s' % (file2['title'],
    file2['mimeType']))
    # Created file hello.png with mimeType image/png

    file3 = drive.CreateFile({'id': file2['id']})
    print('Downloading file %s from Google Drive' % file3['title']) # 'hello.png'
    file3.GetContentFile('world.png')  # Save Drive file as a local file

    # or download Google Docs files in an export format provided.
    # downloading a docs document as an html file:
    docsfile.GetContentFile('test.html', mimetype='text/html')

File listing pagination made easy
---------------------------------

*PyDrive* handles file listing pagination for you.

.. code:: python

    # Auto-iterate through all files that matches this query
    file_list = drive.ListFile({'q': "'root' in parents"}).GetList()
    for file1 in file_list:
      print('title: %s, id: %s' % (file1['title'], file1['id']))

    # Paginate file lists by specifying number of max results
    for file_list in drive.ListFile({'maxResults': 10}):
      print 'Received %s files from Files.list()' % len(file_list) # <= 10
      for file1 in file_list:
        print('title: %s, id: %s' % (file1['title'], file1['id']))

Concurrent access made easy
---------------------------

All calls made are thread-safe. The underlying implementation in the
google-api-client library
`is not thread-safe <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/thread_safety>`_,
which means that every request has to re-authenticate an http object. You
can avoid this overhead by
creating your own http object for each thread and re-use it for every call.

This can be done as follows:

.. code:: python

    # Create httplib.Http() object.
    http = drive.auth.Get_Http_Object()

    # Create file object to upload.
    file_obj = drive.CreateFile()
    file_obj['title'] = "file name"

    # Upload the file and pass the http object into the call to Upload.
    file_obj.Upload(param={"http": http})

You can specify the http-object in every access method which takes a *param*
parameter.
